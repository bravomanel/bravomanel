            <h3 id="type">Cut of Beef</h3>
                <h4>What Beef Cuts</h4>
                    <p>Usually you should opt for the front cuts, since the rear cuts are more expensive, and after the grind the meat lose most of the caracteristcs that justify the price, only the flavor remains</p>
                    <p>The most importante for the best hamburguer is that the beef is fresh, never frozen, and grinded only a few hours before the meat is fried.</p>
                    <p>In some special cases you can choose an rear cut, as long as you adjust the blend for the meat, which we will be talking next.</p>
                <h4>Fat Percentage</h4>
                    <p>The ideal fat percentage for frying the hamburguer is 20%, and you can get this by blending 50% to 60% of a fatty meat with 40% to 50% of a lean one</p>
                    <p>For grilled burguer you should consider 25% or even 30%</p>
                    <p>For well done burguers you should consider 5% more fat percentage, since the burguer loses more fat in the cooking process</p>
                <h4>Blends</h4>
                    <p></p>
